# HashMap Experimental Analysis
Back to [[archive/experiments/Data Structures and Algorithms/Index|Index]]

*CS 253* · Leo Winston · February 2026

> [!abstract] Abstract
> This project details an experimental analysis of a separate-chaining HashMap, investigating how altering the maximum load factor influences collision resolution, table resizing, and lookup efficiency. By simulating up to $50,000$ insertions, we tracked average chain lengths, total collisions, and resize frequencies across three distinct maximum load factor thresholds: $0.50$, $1.00$, and $2.00$. The data demonstrates that lower load factors aggressively trigger capacity doubling to maintain sparser tables and near $\mathcal{O}(1)$ lookup times, whereas higher load factors tolerate greater bucket density, pushing average chain lengths well above $2.0$. Ultimately, this experiment highlights the fundamental trade-off in hash table design between optimizing for lookup efficiency via strict load constraints versus minimizing the computational and memory overhead of frequent rehashing.

### Trends
I chose $0.5$, $1.0$, and $2.0$ as the maximum load factors because they are the most distinct of the five, which lets us see larger distinctions in the data. The average chain length of higher load factors consistently exceeds that of lower load factors regardless of the number of insertions, with maxLF $= 2.00$ maintaining an average chain length roughly $1.5\times$ to $2\times$ that of maxLF $= 0.50$ throughout the experiment.

### Resizing Behavior
As entries are inserted, chains grow until the load factor exceeds the maximum, which causes a resize that doubles capacity and rehashes everything, this is the cause for the spikes in the plot. A lower maximum load factor triggers resizing more aggressively, keeping the table sparse (at the cost of more memory). maxLF $= 0.50$ resizes so frequently that its average chain length drops to exactly $1.0$, while maxLF $= 2.00$ tolerates much higher density, so each bucket chain contains more entries on average. This is reflected in the data, at $2.0707$ average chain length when the hashmap size is $15{,}000$ inserts.

### Collision Behavior
The maximum load factor controls how full the table gets before resizing, directly determining how many collisions accumulate. Since chain traversal costs $\mathcal{O}(k)$ where $k$ is the chain length, a lower load factor keeps $k$ near $1$, keeping lookup performance at $\mathcal{O}(1)$, while a higher load factor trades this for less frequent resizes.
